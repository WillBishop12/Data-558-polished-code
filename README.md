# Data-558-polished-code

These files implement the kernel SVM statistical learning method, including downloading/generating relevant data, visualizing the training process, and printing the performance. The user may adjust parameters as desired.

* kernel_svm_simulated.py: runs kernel SVM on a simulated dataset
* kernel_svm_digits.py: runs kernel SVM on the digits dataset from scikit-learn

Each file also contains the scikit-learn implementation of kernel SVM so the two results can be compared.
